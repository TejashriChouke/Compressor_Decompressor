# Compressor_Decompressor
This is a minor project on compressor and decompresssor using java and javaSwing language.

Compressor : Compressor means data compressor. Data Compressor : Data Compressor is basically technique which helps in reduction in the number of bits which are used needed to represent the data.

It strictly focuses on lossless conversion methods to ensure data integrity throughout the compression process. By implementing this project, users can benefit from various advantages of compression, including efficient storage utilization, accelerated file transfers, and decreased storage hardware and network bandwidth expenses. The emphasis on lossless compression techniques guarantees that no data is lost during the compression process, safeguarding the integrity of the compressed data.

Decompressor : Decompressor is basically the process of restaring the compress data to the original from is known as decompressor and the process of doing this end the platfrom and the device software which is used to do that is known as decompressor. Data Decompressor : Data Decompressor means is required in every case because in order to use compress file if we want to used that compress file if we want to used that decompressor first. if have to converted back to the original from first and then you can only used it, so decompressor is basically in needed mandatory thing to be use in every case.

Features of the Compressor and Decompressor : Gzip Compression : The project implements the Gzip compression algorithm to reduce the size of files. Gzip Decompression : It also provides the functionality to decompress Gzip-compressed files. User Interface : The project includes a user-friendly GUI built with java Swing, allowing users to easily interact with the application. File Selection : User can select the file they want to compress or decompress using the file selection dialog. Progress Tracking : The project displays the progress of compression or decompression operations, giving users an idea of the process completion.
